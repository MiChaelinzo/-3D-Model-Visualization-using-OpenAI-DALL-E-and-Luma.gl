# -3D-Model-Visualization-using-OpenAI-DALL-E-and-Luma.gl
This code generates a 3D model visualization using OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate an image based on a text prompt, and then uses the Luma.gl library to display the generated image in a 3D scene. The program sends an API request to the DALL-E API with a specified prompt, and retrieves the generated image URL from the response. The program then downloads and displays the image using the PIL library, and creates a texture from the image using the Luma.gl library. The texture is then used to render a 3D model of the image in a 3D scene using the OpenGL graphics library. The program runs in real-time, allowing the user to interact with the 3D model and view it from different angles.
